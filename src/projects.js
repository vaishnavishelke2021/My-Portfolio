Using React and Tailwind CSS, we created a responsive and user-friendly layout, integrating GSAP for smooth animations. My responsibilities included research on design, front-end development, and ensuring the siteâ€™s responsiveness. Throughout the project, my fellow intern and I collaborated using GitHub to efficiently manage the development process. Additionally, I leveraged ChatGPT to optimize the code, ensuring better efficiency and scalability.",
