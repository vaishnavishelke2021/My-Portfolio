      "I contributed to the development of a comprehensive Uranium Tracker website built to provide real-time information about uranium, including stocks, news, analysis, and insider transactions. Built using React, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, and Axios, the project involved fetching data from multiple APIs to deliver dynamic and up-to-date content. My responsibilities included integrating APIs & implementing responsive designs. Throughout the project, we constantly iterated on designs and updated the site based on client feedback to meet their expectations. Additionaly. I utilized ChatGPT to refine the code for better performance and scalability.",
